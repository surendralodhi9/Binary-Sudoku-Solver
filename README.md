# Rules
Each binary puzzle has to be solved according to the following rules:

1. Each box should contain either a zero or a one.

2. More than two equal numbers immediately next to or below each are not allowed.

3. Each row and each column should contain an equal number of zeros and ones.

4. Each row is unique and each column is unique. Thus, any row cannot be exactly equal to another row, and any column cannot be exactly equal to another column.

Each binary puzzle has a unique solution. It is always possible to make a next step by reasoning. In other words, the solution can always be found without guessing.
